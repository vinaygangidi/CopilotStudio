"If you've ever played around with Microsoft Power Virtual Agent, you know exactly what I’m talking about!"
Building a custom chatbot can greatly enhance user engagement and streamline communication. With Microsoft’s Copilot Studio, you can boost chatbot performance by focusing on conversational topics. These topics enable chatbots to handle a wide range of user inputs, making interactions more fluid and natural. In this article, we’ll guide you through creating conversational topics in Copilot Studio and explore how they enhance chatbot conversations for a seamless user experience. Recent advancements also allow these topics to connect to multiple knowledge sources, providing generative answers to users.

What Are Conversational Topics?
Conversational topics are structured conversation paths that enable chatbots to understand and accurately respond to user inputs. They form the backbone of Copilot chatbots, allowing them to recognize and handle various inquiries without requiring specific command phrasing. By using conversational topics, chatbots can interpret different ways users ask questions, fostering more natural interactions.

"For example, a topic like "Schedule a Meeting" can address various user inputs such as "Can you book a meeting?" or "I need to set up a call," all within the same framework."
Copilot Studio features a user-friendly canvas that allows for the creation of conditional, flow-based topics with minimal coding knowledge. When you create a new bot in Copilot Studio, it generates both custom and system topics by default. These topics begin with trigger conditions that can include multiple phrases or handle unknown intents, directing users along the correct conversational paths.

Custom Topics: Custom topics are tailored to specific needs, enabling you to create unique conversation paths like "Track My Order" or "Schedule a Meeting." They provide full control over the chatbot’s responses, making them ideal for specific business scenarios. You can easily delete or modify these topics as required.

System Topics: In contrast, system topics are pre-built and designed for generic tasks such as end of conversations, conversation boosting, fallback approaches, goodbyes, or escalation. These ready-made solutions help streamline common interactions but cannot be deleted. System topics enhance chatbot functionality by ensuring it can manage basic conversational elements effectively.


Within Copilot Studio topics, you can define local and global variables to store user responses, intents, and more. With a basic understanding of coding, you can easily create and manage these flows.

The Copilot Studio Topics Canvas offers various options for setting triggers and includes multiple connectors to enhance your topic flow. This flexibility allows you to design more dynamic and responsive chatbot interactions.





Each flow in Copilot Studio can utilize multiple types of connectors, including conditional, advanced, and action connectors. This flexibility allows for seamless integration of topics with various actions and Power Automate flows, enhancing the overall functionality and responsiveness of your chatbot.









Creating and using conversational topics in Copilot Studio provides significant benefits for both developers and users. By enhancing a chatbot's ability to understand user intent and facilitating smooth conversations, these topics foster better engagement and seamless interactions. Whether for customer service, e-commerce, or internal operations, conversational topics are essential for building a responsive and intelligent chatbot experience.

Thanks to Copilot Studio’s user-friendly interface, implementing these topics has never been easier, allowing you to focus on designing conversations that feel natural and effective for your users.
